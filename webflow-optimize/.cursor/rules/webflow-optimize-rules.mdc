# Webflow Optimization Project Rules

## Project Structure
- All optimization rules should be placed in their respective component files
- Component files should follow the naming convention: `component-purpose-type.ext`
- Reusable utilities should be extracted into a shared folder

## Coding Standards
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Prefer functional programming patterns where possible
- Add JSDoc comments for all exported functions
- Optimize for performance and load time as primary goals

## Webflow Specifics
- Follow Webflow's best practices for DOM manipulation
- Minimize custom JavaScript when native Webflow features can be used
- When working with collections, use Webflow's collection API
- For e-commerce components, ensure mobile responsiveness

## Performance Guidelines
- Images should be optimized and lazy-loaded
- Minimize DOM operations in high-traffic pages
- Use debounce for scroll and resize events
- Keep third-party dependencies to a minimum

## Project-Specific Rules
- For product pages (pdp), ensure all pricing calculations are consistent
- Collection filters should maintain state across page loads
- Value savings components should highlight the discount percentage
- Popular categories should be dynamically updated based on traffic data
